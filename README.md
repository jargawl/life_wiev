LifeView 🏝️

The LifeView app will allow you to stop for a moment and think about owning your life 👀. It's an emotional tracker that will let you think about what emotions you experience the most✍️. 
With LifeView you can think about what you are grateful for in your life ☀️, what your goals are 📈, and in the dreams section you can say out loud what you dream about 🚀🚀🚀! 

In my application I used : REST API, JSON, Get_it, Injecteable, Bloc/Cubit, Unit tests, Freezed, Dio, Retrofit, Firebase Database, Firebase Authentication.
